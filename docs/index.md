# Introduction
[Instructions on how to integrate the widget are here.](./widget.md)

Onramper allows you to let your users buy crypto directly on your website or app. Onramper is a fiat-to-crypto onramp aggregator, which implements all major onramps in a single solution. This allows businesses to get global coverage of supported countries, payment methods, cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. At the same time, businesses are free to implement their [own fees](#fees) on every user transaction.

# The Widget
The widget can be easily implemented on your app/wallet, so you can focus on getting users, instead of having to integrate multiple fiat onramps yourself. The widget can be integrated in as little as 5 minutes. It is possible to customize the widget to only show certain currencies, payment methods, etc. You can also automatically insert the user's public key, and change the widget's colours to match your site/app.

# The API
Onramper can be implemented by connecting to our API. As such, businesses will be able to integrate Onramper however they want. Connecting by API is more work, but allows you to fully build your own UX/UI. Note that our widget is highly customizable by itself, and integration of the widget ensures you instantly get every update we do on your integration.

# Fees
We don’t charge integration costs and don’t have a monthly subscription. Instead, Onramper is paid by the various fiat onramps. We do not add fees on top for users. In addition, Onramper gets fee discounts with its partner on-ramps due to the high amount of transaction volumes it does. 

Finally, by being able to pick the lowest-fee fiat gateway usually gets over 1.5% additional crypto. As such, Onramper is a lot cheaper for end-users in aggregate! You can also add your own fees on top of every transaction. For this you'll need to use a special API key provided by us.
